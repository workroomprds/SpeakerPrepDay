### Presents
* Stand in a cirle. Imagine you could give anything to one person in this group. Who would you give it it? What would you give?
* One person – decide on a present for someone else. Silently, give that person your present.
* That person – receive the present with delight. Say what it is. Then, give a diffetent present to someone else.

*Purpose – to delight and surprise with misinterpretations. To get the group to play togther. To enjoy the random.*

### Line by line story
* Take turns
* Use (at least some) of the information in the previous line.
* Make your partner look good.
* Stuck? Refer to shared history. Be specific. Raise the stakes. Continue the plan. Agree and expand.
* Hint: Avoid questions, unless rhetorical.
* Hint: No need to think of anything before the most recent line. No need to aim for the future.
 
*Purpose – to listen and to respond.*


### Ask a testing question
* Write a generic question that involves a story (not an opinion or a plan). Examples: How did you get started in testing? Tell me about a bug that got fixed. What have you done today? How was your journey to Potsdam? Tell me about your first conference. 
* Exchange questions (JL and BK to introduce ringers). Exchange again. If you don't like your question, exchange with James or Bart.
* Get into 2s or 3s.
* Each of you, answer your question in 20s. Beforehand, pick a mood for your story – "You'll never believe it", suspenseful, "There was nothing I could do", "Which was great!", suspicious, lucky, doomed. Try to tell your story with that mood.
* Try to tell someone else's story back to them, with a *different* mood.

*Purpose – practice storytelling with differnt emotions*
