Small group – 3-8 people, 30-60 minutes.

### Process

**5 mins** to prime... 

think of

* What part of your talk needs a trick?
* What’s a trick you want to try?

(If individuals aren’t in a position to ask these, try: what leaps out at you when you search for speaker tricks / use a book?)

Keep this to one side, on purpose: What’s a trick you’ve used and want to share?

**20 mins** or more to go round the group :

“My thing that needs a trick is ...  what have you done that might help?” 

OR 

“I want to try ... have you done that?”

Put forward, see who’s got something, invite two of them to reply. 

Timebox.

**5-10 minutes** at the end to share stuff you’ve tried and liked. 

Build a gallery / collection of tips while doing this.

> Note: go-round – try least-experienced earlier?

> Note: To help move from topic to topic: suggest that questioners can ask individuals for contributions, seek 2 answers per Q. Moving from topic to topic covers more ground, but requires speed. 

> Note: To avoid the group being domainated (however unintentionally) by one or two people, try to respond to direct requests rather than interject. If you’ve got a great trick to share, write it down and add it to a pile to put up later. 

> Facilitators – help with the pile of info, the shift of focus, and the timings.
