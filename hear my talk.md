## Process
This exercise gives you instant, real feedback on your delivery and content

We’ll need 2-4 speakers who are prepared to do very condensed talks and to get feedback.
If you’re up for it, you’ll do the same very short talk, 3 times. 
We will record your talk on your own phone.

First time – 3 minutes. 
You go away, watch the talk, make changes.

Second time – 3 minutes.
You ask the audience for feedback.

Third time – 2 minutes
 Lots of applause

At the end, we have a swift go-round talking about what was great about the talks, and perhaps what became great.

## Audience rules
This is not a PowerPoint karaoke bearpit. Please:
* Be observant
* Be fair
* Be lovely
