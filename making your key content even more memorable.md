Scheduled workshop. During the workshop, we will work together to:

* Individually identify our key content – then do a 30-second pitch to the group. Will you primarily inform, inspire, entertain, persuade, give an experience – or something else?
* Consider all the ways we’re putting that message across. Consider when in our talks we're setting out that message, what suport for each occasion.
* Consider your audience – who will use your message, and what emotional reaction do you hope they might.
* Consider different media – statement, picture, story, slogan, joke, example, counter-example, logical argument, sincere appeal, warning, vision.
* Sloganise one core message - short phrase using alliteration and rhymes.
* Exchange slogans
