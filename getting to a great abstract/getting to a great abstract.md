A 30 minute exercise ending up in a worthwhile short abstract for your idea.

### Process
* Have a chat about your idea and existing abstract

* Write something down!
* Ask for review, comments, advice
* (optional) Add your abstract to the gallery and ask for public comments
* Set milestones for next steps

### Great abstract
* catchy title
* idea that has potential
* indicates that thought and work has gone into communicating the message
* /brief/ problem statement
* real examples
* demonstrates experience
* clear takeaways
* relevant to event
* easy to read, draws you onwards
* non-trivial
* has substance – more than a tease, less than a paper
* more than just the bright side – pitfalls, failures, antipatterns, pathologies
* within word limit (and more than a couple of sentences)
* offers interaction or demonstration

----

### Poor abstract
* claims expertise / authority
* problem excludes content
* poorly written, poorly proofread
* unstructured or incoherent
* buzzwords
* single tool
* happy paths only
* One true mthod / "I'm right"
* Emotionless
* Tired topic
