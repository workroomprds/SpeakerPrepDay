Workshop your nightmare questions with us. We'll help you to find great answers!

Add some principles to our list. 

<hr>

Here's a list of horrible generic questions

* Why didn’t you use *technique / tool * 
* *Whoever* says this is a terible idea
* Isn’t that *whoever's* idea
* What’s the purpose - what’s it good for?
* Have you actually done this?
* Why would I believe you – what qualifies your opinion?
* Where’s the data?

<hr>
 
Here are some reasons to take a question later

* off-topic
* repeated
* not a question
* failure to understand each other's context
* very long question
* can't be answered in the available time
* needed long dialogue to understand necessary context
* exposes the questioner to ridicule

You  might feel that, as the person on stage, one of your jobs is to honour the crowd – and these kinds of questions prioritise the interest of an individual.
